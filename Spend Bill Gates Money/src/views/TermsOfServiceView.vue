        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 19, 2025</p>

        <section>
          <h2>General Information</h2>
          <p>
            The following Terms of Service (the "Agreement") are important and require careful reading. Your acceptance
            of
            these "Terms of Service" signifies your agreement to be bound by them. This Agreement is between you and
            <strong>["spendgatesmoney.com"]</strong> (hereinafter: "Site", "us", "we", or "our") and pertains to your use of
            our
            website, including any materials and services available therein, and any successor site(s) thereto (the
            "Site").
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE OLDER THAN 16
              YEARS.</strong> Any reference to "you" or "your" in this Agreement applies to the individual who uses the
            Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Agreement includes a mandatory arbitration provision, explained in Section 11 below. This provision
            requires arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials, court proceedings,
            or class actions. Please review this section carefully.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Changes</h2>
          <p>
            This Agreement may be amended periodically, and we will notify you of such changes through reasonable means,
            which may include posting a revised Agreement on the Site. Any changes made will not apply to disputes that
            arose prior to the date of such changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using the Site after changes are posted, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. Continued use will
            be
            deemed acceptance of the changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify or discontinue all or part of the Site, adjust or waive fees, or offer
            special
            opportunities to some or all Site users at any time, without liability.
